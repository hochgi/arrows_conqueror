/**
 * Selection chrome — the selected halo, and the quiet floor the reach wash sits on.
 *
 * Packet P31, trimmed by P34. P31's deferred cost (a min-count numeral on the
 * hovered destination) and its path-only commit both belonged to
 * source → destination → portion, and P34 retired that flow: there is no
 * destination to hover a price for, and no dialog to wash a path under. What
 * survives is the halo that says *this stack is selected* and the wash floor the
 * route's faintest tier is drawn at (`route.ts`).
 *
 * Pure: equal phase + highlights + pointer kind → equal paint. No clocks, no RNG.
