/**
 * Rebuild the per-move chain behind an applied batch.
 *
 * The adapter commits a whole trip — or a bot's turn — in one go, so all it holds
 * afterwards is the state either side of the batch. A single before/after diff
 * collapses everything that happened into one indistinguishable blob: a trip that
 * split on step one and closed on step three would present as a split *and* a
 * closure at the same instant, which is the opposite of showing a causal chain.
 *
 * So the chain is rebuilt by re-applying the moves. That is exact rather than
 * approximate for one specific reason: `apply` is a pure, deterministic function of
 * `(state, move)` (ADR 0001), so replaying a batch that already succeeded reproduces
 * the same intermediate states it produced the first time. This is the same property
 * P10's replay harness rests on, used one turn at a time.
 *
 * Presentation only: the returned states decorate a board that already renders the
 * authoritative `after`, and a failed rebuild degrades to one coarse step rather
 * than to a wrong board.
