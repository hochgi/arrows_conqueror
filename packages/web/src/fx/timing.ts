/**
 * One timing vocabulary for every gameplay effect.
 *
 * Presentation only — nothing here is read by the rules. The numbers exist in one
 * place so the board keeps a *consistent* language: a player learns that a short
 * localized flash means combat and a spatial fill means capture, and that lesson
 * only holds if every capture takes the same time as every other one.
 *
 * The upper bound is deliberate. The state transition has already happened by the
 * time any of this runs — an effect is drawn *around* a committed `apply`, never
 * in front of one — so a long effect never delays input. It would still be a lie
 * about how fast the game is, which is why {@link MAJOR_SEQUENCE_MS} is the budget
 * for the chain the numbers are *tuned* against.
 *
 * **It is a budget and not a measurement, and the difference matters.** The claim
 * that used to stand here — that the biggest sequence in the game
 * (enclosure → capture → production) fits inside `MAJOR_SEQUENCE_MS` — is false, and
 * P38 leaned on it before measuring: `captureFresh` alone is offset 500 with a
 * duration of 700 and therefore settles at **1200**, against a stated 700. Nothing
 * downstream may treat this constant as the settle time of a real queue. Anything
 * that needs *when the effects of a move have finished* takes it from the queue —
 * `queueSettleMs`, or `max(offset + lifetime)` over the items present — so it cannot
 * go stale when one of the numbers below moves. Retuning them is a separate job.
