/**
 * Resolved gameplay events — a *reading* of one `apply`, for the presentation layer.
 *
 * The rules engine stays the only thing that decides anything. This module diffs the
 * state it produced (`before` → `after`, plus the `Move` that caused it) and names
 * what changed, so a renderer can say `showEvent(trailCut)` instead of trying to
 * infer a cut from arbitrary state differences at paint time.
 *
 * Two lines that are easy to cross and must not be:
 *
 *   - **Nothing here re-decides a rule.** There is no closure test, no even-odd
 *     fill, no chord test, no combat table. Every field is read out of the diff.
 *     The step's `exit` is used *only* to anchor an effect in space — never to
 *     decide whether something happened.
 *   - **Nothing here is authoritative.** If an event is dropped, mis-ordered, or
 *     never rendered, the board is still correct, because the board renders
 *     `after` and the events only decorate it.
 *
 * Pure and deterministic: no clock, no randomness, and every arrow set leaves here
 * sorted by id, because a `Set` iteration order feeding a staggered animation is
 * exactly the kind of ordering bug ADR 0001 warns about.
