/**
 * Ray-run route drafting — what is clickable from the tip, and how it paints.
 *
 * Packet P34. `docs/spec/ray-run-input/ray-run-input.md`.
 *
 * A route is a **word over three out-slots**. Because the three out-directions
 * sum to zero, a shortest route's prefix uses at most two of them, and a
 * destination fixes the word's last letter — so a destination has exactly one
 * route **iff** its word is `s^m` or `s^m·e`: straight along one slot, then
 * optionally one turn at the end. That set is what this module offers, which is
 * why no route is ever picked by the adapter: every arrow of the draft was named
 * by a click.
 *
 * There is deliberately **no `remaining <= 2` special case**. Everything within
 * two steps has word `s·e`, a prefix of length one, so the general rule already
 * covers it.
 *
 * **Measured, never derived.** Every hop is offered only because `rules.apply`
 * accepted it on a scratch state, exactly as `reach.ts` already does.
 * `speed(carry)` and {@link MAX_DEPTH} only *bound* the search; the engine
 * decides every step, so a rule change moves the offer with it.
 *
 * Pure: equal state + tip + carry + draft produce equal rays, turn arrows and
 * paint. No clock, no randomness.
 *
 * @see docs/spec/ray-run-input/ray-run-input.md

 *    is building, and taking Send, Cancel and pop away at the last click would
 *    surprise them;
 * 2. the run's count has exactly **one** legal value — with two there is a
 *    choice to offer;
 * 3. the new tip offers **nothing** clickable — with a ray left the route may
 *    continue, and applying would cut it short.
 *
 * Condition 3 is **implied** by 1 and 2 — one legal count for a `k` step run
 * means the ceiling is exactly `2^(k-1)`, so the allowance is exactly spent and
 * nothing can be clickable — and is kept anyway, because it makes the rule
 * readable without that argument and would still hold if the allowance formula
 * moved. No reachable state satisfies 1 and 2 and fails 3, so no test asserts
