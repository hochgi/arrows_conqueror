/**
 * P34 core scenarios — `docs/spec/ray-run-input/ray-run-input.core.feature`.
 *
 * One test per scenario. Scenarios about the *content* of the offer go through
 * the pure helper (`buildRouteOffer`), which is what the spec's pseudocode
 * declares; scenarios about the *state machine* go through the input mode. The
 * invariants suite ties the two together.
 *
 * Eight heads walk four steps (§3, `speed(8) = 4`), so on the open field the
 * offer is 3 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 30 arrows: 12 ray arrows and 18 turn arrows. The turns
 * off the *last* ray arrow are not offered — they would be a fifth step, and the
 * engine refuses it. That is measured here rather than assumed.
