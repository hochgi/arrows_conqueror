/**
 * P35 invariants — the twenty-three EARS statements in
 * `docs/spec/count-after-route/count-after-route.md`, one property test each.
 *
 * Properties run over a bank of boards and drafts rather than one example: the
 * generated tiling at three stack sizes, a truncated ray, a merge, an adjacent
 * enemy, and **both** fixture boards, each driven through one- and two-run
 * drafts. A case's clicks are read off the offer itself (`ray N of slot S`)
 * rather than hard-coded, so the same plan is meaningful on an abstract fixture
 * board where a slot carries no geometry.
 *
 * Every count claim is checked against {@link countsThatWalk}, which walks
 * `rules.apply` at 1, 2, 3 … heads and consults `speed()` nowhere. That is the
 * point of "the floor is measured, never derived": if the offer and the engine
 * disagree, the test says which numbers.
 *
 * Each property asserts **non-vacuity** first. An unimplemented helper that
 * returns an empty list satisfies almost every "nothing exceeds" claim, and the
 * one that matters most here — *the control is absent* — is satisfied by a
 * control that is never drawn at all.
 *
 * Invariant 15 is the one the spec explicitly narrows: the overlap of the docked
 * strip with the clickable set needs a real renderer and is a browser check
 * before the PR. What is asserted here is the part that makes it true by
 * construction — the control's model carries no viewport, stage or tip
 * coordinate, and is identical at every width.
