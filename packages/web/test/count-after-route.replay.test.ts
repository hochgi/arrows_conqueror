/**
 * P35 replay — the click-then-count gesture produces one exact move list.
 *
 * P35 reorders the two questions a route asks, and the ordering is a turn-flow
 * change: the same final list is now reached by *clicking first and counting
 * after*, and a rewrite of the last run has to leave the earlier moves alone
 * byte for byte. A golden list plus a golden occupancy is the cheapest detector
 * of both a rewrite that reaches too far back and any accidental nondeterminism
 * in the offer that feeds it.
 *
 * The goldens are written out by hand. One read back from the implementation
 * would prove only that it is self-consistent.
 *
 * The first fixture is deliberately **the same golden P34's replay asserts** —
 * `8, 8, 4` down one ray — reached with the carry set *after* each click instead
 * of before it. That the two gestures land on the same list is the whole claim of
 * the inversion: nothing about what a route may legally be has changed.
