/**
 * `selectionChrome.ts` — what survives of P31 after P34 trimmed it.
 *
 * P31's source → destination → portion ladder died with the `portion` phase, and
 * its min-count numeral and path wash went with it: there is no destination to
 * price and no dialog to wash a path under. Two things survive, and they are
 * asserted here rather than in P34's Gherkin suite because they are P31's
 * behaviour, not P34's:
 *
 * - the **halo** that says *this stack is selected*, in every phase that has a
 *   source (`route` and `blocked` alike);
 * - the **wash constants** the route's faintest tier is drawn at (`route.ts`,
 *   `Board.tsx`) — a mutation to either is a visible paint change with nothing
 *   else watching it.
 *
 * Moved here from the retired `selection-chrome.{core,edge-cases,invariants}`
 * trio; every assertion below was live behaviour in one of them.
