/**
 * Fixtures and oracles for P34 ray-run route input.
 *
 * Two boards, one set of helpers: the generated tiling (`geometry` / `rules`)
 * for anything about the real lattice — the nine-per-distance counts, ray
 * straightness by slot, ambiguity beginning at distance 3 — and the hand-authored
 * fixtures (`fixtureBoard`) where a short cycle or a readable failure is the
 * point.
 *
 * The **oracle** here is deliberately *not* the ray construction. It enumerates
 * every walk the engine accepts and counts the shortest routes to each arrow, so
 * "the clickable set is the unique-route set" is checked against an independent
 * measurement rather than against a second copy of the implementation.
