/**
 * Fixtures and oracles for P35 — name the route, then say how many heads walk it.
 *
 * Built on P34's support (`ray-run-input.support.ts`), which already owns the two
 * boards, the state builders and the input-mode helpers. What is new here is the
 * **run** as a unit: the counts that walk a whole run, where a run began, and how
 * a draft is built by clicking and *then* counting.
 *
 * The oracle for a run's offerable counts is deliberately not the implementation:
 * {@link countsThatWalk} walks `rules.apply` itself, step by step, at every count
 * from 1 up to the heads standing where the run began. If `runCarries` and this
 * disagree, one of them is wrong and the test says which numbers.
