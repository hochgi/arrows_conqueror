/**
 * Trails and crossings.
 *
 * SPEC §5 (safety rule; branching is free under P22), §6.1a (a trail is a set,
 * all-to-all points), §6.1 (anchor grades, including legal dormant), §2 (the
 * chord test). P05 decisions D1–D9; P22 withdraws the branch toll.
 *
 * Purity applies from the first line: no clock, no randomness, no I/O, no mutation
 * of an input state. The realistic risk here is not `Math.random` but **iteration
 * order** — a trail is a `Set` and a chord list is an ordered answer derived from
 * one, which is the exact shape ADR 0001 warns about. Two habits keep it out:
 *
 * - Every list of trail arrows is read off `GeometryPort` and *filtered* by the
 *   set, never iterated from it. The port's order is authored and stable, so a
 *   chord list is a function of the board rather than of how a test happened to
 *   build its state.
 * - Every trail set this file returns is rebuilt **sorted**, unconditionally.
 *   Iteration order is observable, so two states that differ only in insertion
 *   order would otherwise yield outputs that differ only in iteration order —
 *   which passes every unit test and surfaces as replay drift.
 *
 * Nothing here reads a vertex. A special is owned in thirds by its three bordering
 * arrows (§7, §11 item 34), so vertex ownership is a *reading* of tile ownership,
 * and this packet owns no tiles.

   * What holds a stretch of trail live (§6.1, P05 D7).
   *
   * Connectivity over the trail set is **undirected** — two trail arrows are one
   * stretch when they share a point, whichever way either points. §7's pincer says
   * outright that enclosure is a property of the curve and not of the flow along
   * it, and §6.1 re-attaches a fragment by laying a fresh path *to* it, against the
   * direction the fragment was laid; a grade computed along the grain refuses both.
   *
   * **What counts as reaching territory is the departure**, and that is directional
   * because §7 makes it so: a closure is *departing your own territory and landing
   * back on it*, so the anchor a trail rests on is the ground it left. §6.1 says the
   * same from the other side — a deep cut takes "the region touching the victim's
   * territory" and everything beyond it survives with "the territory anchor gone",
   * which is only a demotion if the anchor was the departure. So a stretch is
   * territory grade when some arrow of it leaves a point one of the player's own
   * territory arrows feeds, and re-attachment (§6.1) is the ordinary case of that:
   * lay a road from home to the fragment and the whole component is promoted.
   *
   * A trail that merely *runs into* territory it never left is **stack grade** —
   * §6.3 is explicit that a raider's trail does not earn a territory anchor however
   * well it is garrisoned, and stack grade is exactly "drivable home for a land
   * bridge, encloses nothing".
   *
   * The flood's visit order is not observable: both answers are existence questions
   * over a connected component, and a component does not depend on how it was walked.
