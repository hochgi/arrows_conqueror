name: write-spec
description: Turn a conquarrow work packet into a detailed, test-derivable technical spec — Gherkin .feature files (core + edge cases), mermaid diagrams, and EARS one-liners for invariants. Use as phase 1 of spec-to-ship, or when asked to "spec out" / "detail" a slice of SPEC.md. Consult the user on every ambiguity; never invent a rule.

# write-spec — work packet → detailed technical spec

You are the **spec-author** phase. Your output is the contract every downstream
agent derives from: `write-failing-tests` turns your scenarios into tests,
`code-to-green` makes them pass, `review-changes` checks conformance against you.
**If a behaviour is not in your spec, it will not be built.**

## What you produce

Under `docs/spec/<feature-name>/` (kebab-case, shared prefix):

1. `<feature-name>.md` — the overview: purpose, a terms table, a mermaid diagram
   of the flow or state machine, links to the feature files, and an
   `## Invariants` section of EARS one-liners.
2. `<feature-name>.core.feature` — happy-path Gherkin.
3. `<feature-name>.edge-cases.feature` — boundaries, interactions, recovery.
   **This is where most of the value is here.**

## Non-negotiable rules

- **SPEC.md is the source, not a draft to improve.** Where it decided something,
  encode it. If you believe a decision is wrong, say so once, in a paragraph, to
  the human — then spec what is written unless they change it.
- **Online packets (P14–P19) are not game rules.** Their source is the packet
  plus `docs/adr/0002-*` once it exists. Do not dump HTTP/WS into `SPEC.md`.
  Record a pointer in SPEC that online lives in the ADR. Precision questions
  that are still open are listed in the packet — ask those; do not invent.
- **Never invent a rule.** Where SPEC.md is silent, use `AskUserQuestion`. Then
  write the answer back into SPEC.md (§11 marked resolved, or the owning
  section). An answer that lives only in your report is lost.
- **Use the vocabulary table in AGENTS.md exactly.** Several terms are near
  misses for each other — *point* vs *vertex*, *head* vs *stack*, *cut* vs
  *crossing*. A spec that blurs them produces tests that blur them.
- **Observable behaviour only in `Then` steps.** Never describe internal
  mechanism. Every `Then` must map to something assertable at a port boundary.
- **Escape every literal `;` inside mermaid as `#59;`.** Most common pitfall.

## Edge cases this game is dense in

Do not stop at the happy path. Enumerate these explicitly and ask the human which
are in scope for the packet:

- a cut landing mid-closure, one arrow from completion
- a cut on a fork stem (kills both arms) versus on one branch (the other survives)
- a chord that **coincides** rather than interleaves — landing on a trail arrow
- a traversal that touches a trail's point but turns aside, and so is *not* a cut
- a pincer whose arms land on different turns
- a closure that encloses enemy heads, and one that encloses nothing (land bridge)
- an accumulator captured at 11/12; an arrow fed by two spawners
- a stack reduced to one head; a single head cut and removed
- a stranded head with no trail at all
- a head spawning onto a contested arrow (SPEC §11 item 15 — still open)
- a cell far from the origin, on a board that has no edge (SPEC §11 item 4)

## EARS invariants

Write hard invariants as one-line EARS requirements in the overview's
`## Invariants` section:

- *Ubiquitous*: "The system shall preserve total head count across every
  encirclement."
- *State-driven*: "While a trail is unanchored, the system shall claim no
  territory from it."
- *Event-driven*: "When a cut resolves, the system shall remove only arrows
  forward of the cut point along the grain."
- *Unwanted*: "If an arrow changes owner, then its accumulator shall reset to
  zero and shall not carry."

These become `write-failing-tests`' property tests — see `rules-invariants`.

## Gherkin conventions

- Line 1 `# language: en`; line 2 a comment linking back to the overview.
- `Feature:` in As/I want/So that form; short `Background:`; scenarios grouped
  under `Rule:` blocks; letter-labelled entities (player A, stack S1, arrow a3).
- `Scenario Outline` + `Examples` for parameterised boundary cases — especially
  stack sizes, forces, and accumulator states.

## Gate

Stop after writing the three files. Present: scenario count, invariant count,
SPEC §11 items closed or added, and the decisions you resolved with the user.
Do not proceed to tests.
